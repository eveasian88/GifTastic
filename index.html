// create an array of strings related to a topic that interests you
// save it to a variable called topics
// think about what theme i like
// app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML
// use a loop to append a button for each string in the array
// when user clicks the page should grab 10 static non-animated gif images
// when user clicks the still GIPHY images, the gif animates
// if user clicks the gif again, it should stop moving
// under every gif, display its rating 
// only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to continue 

// add a form to your page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your topics array
// then make a function call that takes each topic in the array to remake the buttons on the page -->
